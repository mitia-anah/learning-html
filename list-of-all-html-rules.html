        What are the rules for writing HTML?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are many rules for coding or writing HTML, but here are some examples of that.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> First thing you need is to define a doctype at the top.</li>
        <li> For writing element, you can’t have an end tag without start tag, that’s mean, we always need the form less than/greater than characters because tags are always surrounded by angle brackets.</li>
        <li> We should not use uppercase but use lowercase instead when write an element name.</li>
        <li> Make sure that there is no open bracket or close bracket inside of the tag.</li>
        <li> About <a href="nesting-rules-detail.html">nesting rules</a>, nest element properly. For example, you may have open <mark>header tag</mark> actually there is no header element inside of the <mark>header tag</mark>. Or maybe it happens like this, you may have an open the <mark>header tag</mark> but you forgot to close it, and all the rest of your child element become header element.
                   So have an attention when nesting element to avoid these accidents.</li>
        <li> Need to be good structure in other word it should have good indenting. As we see before, it is always happened when making an arrangement of child element</li>
        <li> To add on what I have been accounted for, following the <a href="attribute-rules-in-detail.html">attribute rules</a> also is one thing that we should not missed.</li>
      </ol>
