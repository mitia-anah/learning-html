          How to write HTML quicker?
        </h2>
        <p>
          we are a bit slow when we write html at the first time that we learn to it. That is obviously likely to happen because we are still beginner.
          However, we can address that situation by ourselves. Here are some good tips to try:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              First and foremost, try to type as fast as you can so that you will not lose your time while writing.
              In addition, practice your typing when you have free time and learn to type faster. Use <mark>KeyBlaze</mark> to help you with that.
              <mark>KeyBlaze</mark> is an app, free software to enhance typing abilities. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Another thing, which the most helpful, is to use the keyboards.
              I found it myself very useful because sometimes I make an error when I type something.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To make your work to be high quality, use <strong>W3C mark up validator</strong> to check your work, so that you can see what is the mistake and what needs to be improved. I recommend you to use it every time before sending your work to the server. 
              The indenting is very important too, so keep using it until you feel satisfy with the structure of your work.
