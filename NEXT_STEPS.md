cd /home/rosny/ccd-projects/learning-html
xdg-open index.html
```

Click through the exercise links to verify everything works.

### 2. Try an Exercise (10 minutes)

Open an exercise in your text editor:
```bash
code exercises/01-homepage.html
```

Complete a few TODOs, save, and refresh in your browser to see it work.

### 3. Review Documentation (5 minutes)

Read the key files:
- `README.md` - Main lab guide
- `QUICK_START.md` - Fast start instructions
- `LAB_CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md` - Overview of changes

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

```bash
# Make sure you're on main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Convert to structured learning lab with exercises and solutions"
git push origin main

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
git checkout -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings pointing to the `gh-pages` branch.

Your lab will be live at: `https://mitia-anah.github.io/learning-html/`

### Option 2: Share Locally

Zip the entire folder and share it:
```bash
cd ..
zip -r learning-html-lab.zip learning-html/
```

Students can unzip and open `index.html` directly.

### Option 3: Use as Local Lab

Keep it on your machine and work through it yourself or use it in a classroom setting.
